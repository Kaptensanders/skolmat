# Context for Codex work

Purpose: minimal cross-thread resume notes for Codex. This file avoids restating
contracts or AGENTS content.

Resume rules:
- Start by stating which phase is under discussion.
- Validate any changes against the UC catalog and design contracts.

References:
- UC catalog: `test/fixtures/usecases.json`
- Design contracts: `docs/design/`
- Decision log: `docs/decisions.md`
