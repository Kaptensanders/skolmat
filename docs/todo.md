# Todo

## Active phases

- Finalize config flow implementation.

## Config flow vs implementation findings

- verify config flow in MS Edge
- add "model" to device (probably does not matter but for niceness)
- config flow: if meals "none" means all, always, the found meals should not be selected by default, that would mean only those meals will be seen
